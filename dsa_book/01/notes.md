__methods__ are executable statements that belong to a __class__ definition.
The name of a class, method, or variable is called __identifier__.

## Base Types (also called __Primitive Types__)
Is the most basic and simple data types, these types build other data types more complex.
| Type | Size (byte)| Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| boolean | 1 | Stores true or false values | 
| byte | 1 | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 |
| char | 2 | Stores a single character/letter or Unicode values
| short | 2 | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
| int | 4 | Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
| float | 4 | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits (IEEE 754-1985)
| long | 8 | Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| double | 8 | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits (IEEE 754-1985)

## Classes and Objects
A Java file is a class, an Object is a Data Type created from a class, an Object is application of the Class properties, The critical __members__ of a class in Java are the following:
- Instance variables (also called __fields__): Represents data associated with an object.
- Methods: Are blocks of code that can be called to perform actions. Methods can accept parameters as arguments. A method that returns information to the caller without changing any
instance variables is known as an __accessor method__, while an __update method__
is one that may change one or more instance variables when called.

## modifiers
__Access modifiers__ are keywords that can be used to control the level of access (also known as visibility) of fields, methods, and constructors in a class. The four access modifiers in Java are public, protected, default, and private.
